Although wider and more long-term studies are still to come, it is interesting to analyse the data currently availible.\n\nIn this project I will take the following dataset to analyse trends in time on social media and the effects it can have on individuals within the scope of these 4 questions:\n\n* Which social media platforms are the most commonly used among the survey participants?\n* Does the time spent on social media have a significant impact on the likelihood of experiencing symptoms associated with mental disorders, specifically ADHD, anxiety, self-esteem issues, and depression??\n* Does age have any correlation in time spent online?\n* What is the most common time online for each relationship group?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Information on the dataset\n\nThis particular dataset comes from a research project for a statistics course at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh which surveyed 481 of individuals in a project aiming at investigating correlation between the amount of time spent on social and mental health.

Contrary to popular belief or stereotypes, this suggests that the age of the participant does not strongly correlate with the amount of time spent online. Therefore, claims blaming younger generations, such as Gen Z, for excessive internet usage may not be entirely accurate or applicable to this dataset.\n\n**Platform Usage Among Survey Participants:** According to the survey data, YouTube was the most commonly used platform among participants, with 85.65% admitting to using it. Following closely behind is Facebook, with 84.62% of participants acknowledging its usage. Notably, this data was collected before the widespread popularity of TikTok during the Covid-19 pandemic. Considering the rapid shifts in social media trends, it would be intriguing to re-survey the same individuals in 2024 to observe any changes in platform preferences over time.\n\n**Relationship Between Time Online and Mental Health:** An interesting trend emerges when analyzing the relationship between time spent online and participants' mental health. As the time spent online increases, every negative mental health average score also increases. This suggests a potential correlation between prolonged internet usage and poorer mental health among participants. However, since this data is on such a small scale, we cannot conclude this to be the truth for the whole population.\n\n**Relationship Status and Time Online:** The groups that spent the most time online were those in a relationship and those who were single, with the most common reponse being More than 5 hours. The divorced groups spent the least amount of time online with less than one hour.\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
